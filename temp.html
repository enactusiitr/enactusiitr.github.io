      Competing against some of the brightest young innovators across the country, Team StubXtract from IIT Roorkee will present its groundbreaking solution to tackle one of India’s<br>
      most pressing environmental challenges—stubble burning. <br><br>The Hult Prize, often referred to as the "Nobel Prize for Students", is a prestigious global competition that challenges<br>
      university students to develop social entrepreneurship solutions for critical global issues. This year’s theme revolves around sustainability and impact-driven innovation,<br>
      making StubXtract a perfect fit for the challenge. With this achievement, our team is not just representing IIT Roorkee but also pioneering a sustainable future for Indian<br>
      agriculture. But what exactly is StubXtract? Let’s explore. StubXtract: Turning Stubble Waste into a Goldmine Every year, thousands of farmers in India resort to stubble burning,<br>
      a practice that releases toxic pollutants into the air, worsens climate change, and depletes soil fertility. Despite government regulations, the lack of cost-effective alternatives<br>
      forces farmers to continue this harmful method. This is where StubXtract comes in. StubXtract is an innovative biorefinery-based solution that converts agricultural waste<br>
      (stubble) into high-value bio-based products like vanillin, polylactic acid (PLA), and lactic acid, all of which have significant industrial applications in food, packaging,<br>
      and medical fields. How Does StubXtract Work? StubXtract introduces a small-scale, mobile, in-situ biorefinery unit that can be deployed directly in fields, allowing farmers<br>
      to process their crop waste on-site. Instead of burning, they can extract valuable chemicals from stubble and sell them for profit. Key Technologies Behind StubXtract - In-Situ<br>
      Biorefinery – Portable units that process stubble on farms, eliminating transport costs - Hemicellulose Hydrolysis – Converts stubble into xylose, a key ingredient for sugar<br>
      substitutes - Lignin Valorization – Extracts vanillin, an eco-friendly alternative to synthetic vanilla - Cellulose to PLA &amp; Lactic Acid Conversion – Produces biodegradable<br>
      bioplastics for food packaging and medical use - Custom Hiring Centers (CHCs) – A Technology-as-a-Service model making it affordable for farmers to rent and use the technology<br>
      Why StubXtract is a Game-Changer Environmental Impact - Prevents millions of tons of CO₂ emissions caused by stubble burning - Improves air quality, reducing respiratory diseases<br>
      in cities - Restores soil fertility, ensuring sustainable agriculture - Reduces dependency on petroleum-based industrial chemicals Economic Impact - Creates a new revenue<br>
      stream for farmers by turning waste into valuable products - Affordable through a rental model (CHCs) for small-scale farmers - Generates employment in rural areas for equipment<br>
      operation and bioprocessing Social &amp; Agricultural Impact - Improves public health by reducing pollution-related diseases - Boosts long-term farm productivity by preventing<br>
      soil degradation - Establishes a circular bioeconomy, benefiting farmers, industries, and local communities Support Us on This Journey Let’s bring this revolutionary idea<br>
      to life. If you’re an investor, policymaker, or industry expert interested in partnering with us, reach out and be part of this transformative movement.<br>
